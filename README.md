### CHALLENGE: Weather forecast

REACT.JS + HTML + CSS

In this repository I have made an application that allows the user to view the forecasted daily weather conditions for a given location using a weather API ðŸ“‹

### HOW TO USE IT ðŸ”§

Run in your terminal:

        npm install

then:

        npm start

and the browser will open the app in your localhost.

### NOW, YOU CAN CHECK THE WEATHER! ðŸš€ ðŸ˜Š



**Tools**
- The images in the project are from this website: https://kaboompics.com/
- The API: openweathermap.org
